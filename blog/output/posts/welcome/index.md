Hello I am Algalan-Meneses Mauricio and I am professor of formal sciences. This blog is about the issues about teaching formal sciences in an undeveloped country. I am from Mexico and the inequalities is one of many issues in the academia of my country. 

I have the fortune to teach in two different universities to students with very distinct backgrounds and goals. Also I study and teach with a different approach because I have a multidisciplinary formation. I have a formation in computation as my bachelor degree and my master degree is in Philosophy of Mathematics. In my studies I have also gain interest in history of mathematics, as you can see in my [master thesis](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/BH125M8TRMGDED7R4PJ1MY2NS4FV9L6EN643Q1FCNVIG9AVU5B-28927?func=full-set-set&set_number=000419&set_entry=000001&format=999), and in philosophy as discipline. 

So I want express the difficulties of being professor in Mexico.
